# GA Blueberry work

### Blueberry Genome assemblies.
+ M7 (Hortblue Petite) (Father)
+ Nui (Mother)
+ M7xNui (Progeny)

## AAT paper
+ Haplotyped genome mapping and functional characterization of a blueberry anthocyanin acetyltransferase (AAT) controlling the accumulation of acylated anthocyanins 


### Data types and assemblies
+ Triobinned M7xNui Hifi reads assembled with HiFiasm into 4 haplotypes. See AAT paper folder.
+ ONT data then FLYE for all three genotypes (M7, Nui and M7xNui). These assemblies are ARCHIVE ONLY.  
+ Illumina for M7 and Nui. 

### See READMEs in folders for more info.
