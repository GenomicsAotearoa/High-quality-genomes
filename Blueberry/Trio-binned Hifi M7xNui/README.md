## Background
Genomics Aotearoa project for assembling tetraploid genomes. This work is mainly being done to identify the Anthocyanin QTL in LG2 for the Growing Future Traits for Life Indoors project. V1.0 of the genome was done using ONT Q20 data. V2.0 will be done using a triobinning approach by combining illumina data of the parents with PacBio HiFi data of the progeny. The goal is to have a fully phased tetraploid genome.

## Data sources
